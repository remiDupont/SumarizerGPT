## The Foundations of Growth Mindset

### Carol Dweck's work on growth mindset
Growth mindset is attributed to the work of Dr. Carol Dweck, a psychology professor at Stanford University. She discovered that feedback based on intelligence can undermine motivation and performance, while feedback based on effort can improve performance. Her research has shown that our narrative and the type of feedback we receive affects our performance and cognition.

### What is growth mindset?
Growth mindset is the concept of embracing challenge and optimizing performance by developing the ability to distance your identity from the challenge or engagement. This involves attaching your identity, motivation, and efforts to the process of learning and improving at anything, rather than attaching it to your performance. This is counterintuitive, as feedback that attaches our identity to performance can actually undermine our performance, especially for those who perform well.

### Research on growth mindset and intelligence feedback
A study conducted by Dweck and her colleague Claudia Mueller in 1998 showed that children who received intelligence feedback tended to select easier problems, performed worse over time, and were more likely to misrepresent their performance than those who received effort feedback. The study revealed that efforts praise is the best way to increase performance in children and reinforces the idea that intelligence is not fixed but malleable and can be improved through dedicated effort.

### The impact of mindset on performance and self-perception
It was found that children who received intelligence-based praise tend to lie about their scores to make themselves appear as having performed better. This indicates that intelligence praise not only undermines performance but also leads to deception about one's abilities. On the other hand, effort-based praise leads to increased persistence, performance, and a more accurate self-assessment.

### Application of growth mindset in everyday life
The concept of growth mindset is applicable in all endeavors and can be instrumental in improving performance. Shifting the narrative from performance-based labels to effort-related verbs, such as acknowledging the effort that goes into learning and improving, can be a practical tool to enhance growth mindset. This exercise can help individuals to understand the actual tools needed to get better at things and avoid setting themselves up for getting worse at the things they already think they're good at.

## The Role of Effort in Growth Mindset

### 1) Involving Effort in Performance
The main focus of this section is on the importance of attaching effort and verbs to one's performance, rather than attaching one's identity to performance. The text emphasizes that attaching effort to good or poor performance allows for improvement, as effort processes enable individuals to continue to get better in a given domain, even when faced with poor results. The effort processes of practicing, persistence, and analyzing errors can be engaged in various endeavors across domains. Therefore, understanding and attributing one's successes and failures to effort-related factors is central to one's improvement and overall performance.

### 2) Influence of Verbs on Identity and Performance
This section highlights the detrimental effects of labels of intelligence and identity praise on performance. It emphasizes that the timing of praise, whether before or after a task, has a significant impact on subsequent performance. Identity praise, such as being labeled as smart or talented, undermines performance, whereas effort praise, focusing on dedicated work and persistence, leads to improved performance. The emphasis is on how the mindset and the type of praise given before, during, or after a task can affect the outcome and subsequent performance.

## Understanding and Developing a Growth Mindset

### 1) Understanding the Brain's Response to Error and Feedback
The text delves into the importance of how individuals respond to errors and feedback that they did not want, suggesting that the answer to why effort praise leads to better performance can be found in how people respond to errors. Reference is made to a study which used event-related potentials (ERPs) to measure brain activity in individuals with different mindsets (fixed versus growth). The study found that individuals with a growth mindset exhibited a stronger cognitive response to errors, whereas those with a fixed mindset had a stronger emotional response to errors. This section focuses on how mindset plays a significant role in how individuals interpret and respond to stress, errors, and feedback.

### 2) Mechanistic Insight into Growth Mindset
This section explores the role of cognitive appraisal and attention in developing a growth mindset. It suggests that by focusing on one's effort, the errors made, and analyzing why the errors occurred, individuals can adopt a growth mindset. The emphasis is on the process of overcoming errors from a cognitive standpoint and devoting one's attention to understanding and improving performance. It also acknowledges the role of training the mind and attention in shaping a growth mindset, highlighting the value of effort, persistence, and resilience in the face of challenges.

# Growth Mindset and Stress-Enhancing Mindset

## Unveiling the Stress-Enhancing Mindset

### Understanding the Power of Stress Enhancing Mindset
#### 1) The Stress Response and Enhanced Focus
The stress response heightens focus, allowing us to pay attention to things that are going wrong and make corrections in the future. This was observed in an ERP study where people with a growth mindset paid more cognitive attention to what happened during and after errors. Embracing a stress-enhancing mindset shifts one's attention towards analyzing why things might be going wrong, helping to allocate thinking towards correcting errors. For example, embracing stress enhanced mindset can shorten cortisol release and increase stroke volume under stress.

#### 2) Physiology and Change in Stress Response
- Cortisol regulation is important but prolonged elevation can interfere with sleep
- Embracing a stress-enhancing mindset allows for shorter cortisol release and increased stroke volume under stress
- Stress shifts blood flow, and stress perception can lead to increased stroke volume, increased peripheral blood flow and better cognitive function

### Synergistic Mindset and Performance

#### 1) Studies by David Yeager on Growth and Stress-Enhancing Mindset
- Large-scale studies of students show that when taught about growth mindset and stress enhancing mindset, students perform better and are able to deal with stress more effectively.
- The interventions yielded significant improvements in performance outcomes including performance under stressful conditions and successful completion of challenging courses.

#### 2) Tools for Building a Growth and Stress-Enhancing Mindset
- Verbs, Not Labels: Feedback should be based on effort, especially when praising performance. Focus on effort rather than innate abilities or intelligence.
- Seeking Help: Seeking help from others is crucial in understanding and learning from mistakes and experiences, as well as understanding what contributed to good performance.
- Writing Exercise: Writing a letter to oneself or others about what growth mindset and stress-enhancing mindset is can improve learning outcomes and performance.

#### 3) Reframing the Mind is Like a Muscle Analogy
- The mind is not like a muscle because we don't experience immediate growth during learning. Understanding that stress and strain during learning are integral to the learning process. Developing mindsets takes time and effort, but is beneficial.

# Conclusion

The research on growth mindset emphasizes the importance of effort-based praise and distancing one's identity from performance in improving motivation and performance. It provides insights into the impact of mindset on learning, self-perception, and deception. Implementation of growth mindset tools, such as shifting the narrative to focus on effort, offers practical ways to enhance performance and learning in everyday life.
